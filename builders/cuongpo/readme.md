## Personal Introduction

> Important: Please take your personal introduction seriously.

Hello! I'm Henry Pham, a blockchain developer passionate about exploring new technologies like Arbitrum Stylus. I'm excited to participate in this workshop to learn about building smart contracts in Rust and deploying them on Arbitrum's innovative WebAssembly-based platform. This hands-on experience with Stylus will help me understand the benefits of memory safety and performance optimization that Rust brings to smart contract development.
